#PFD OPTIMIZER

## Background
Reader Apps uses embedded fonts to render PDF files. 
If embedded fonts are not found, they look up for 
missing fonts on the host machine.

## About Project
This projects demonstrate how we can embed missing 
fonts in PDF file itself.

This application processes PDF files locate in 
directory `D:/Badge` and embed missing font `WASP39LC.TTF`
in all PDFs.
